# Analysis_of_Algorithms\



## Overview

Welcome to this collection of Python algorithm implementations! This repository contains a diverse range of algorithms, each designed to solve specific problems in the field of computer science. The algorithms range from graph theories like bipartite checks and Kruskal's minimum spanning forest, to dynamic programming techniques for computing the longest common subsequence. They also cover optimization problems in resource scheduling and cache replacement strategies.

### Contents

1. `bipartite_graph_checker.py` - Determines if a graph is bipartite.
2. `kruskals_msf_with_union_find.py` - Implements Kruskal's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning forest using the Union-Find data structure.
3. `cache_replacement_comparison.py` - Compares the Farthest-In-Future and First-In-First-Out cache replacement strategies.
4. `city_population_mergesort.py` - Sorts cities based on their populations using merge sort.
5. `longest_common_subsequence_min_length.py` - Finds the length of the longest common subsequence and the minimum length to reach this LCS in two sequences.
6. `minimum_resource_scheduling.py` - Calculates the minimum number of resources required for scheduling tasks.
7. `bellman_ford_shortest_path.py` - Implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.

## Usage

Each script is a standalone Python file. To run a script, simply clone this repository and execute the desired Python file in your terminal:

```bash
python3 <script_name>.py
```

Input data should be provided as specified within each script. Some scripts require interactive inputs, while others might be adapted to read from files or other sources.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided for educational purposes and as a basis for algorithmic understanding. They may not cover all edge cases and could fail in certain test scenarios. Users are encouraged to modify and adapt the code for their specific needs.

## Academic Integrity

If you're using these scripts for academic purposes, please ensure to reference them appropriately to maintain academic integrity. Improper use or representation of this code could result in violations of academic conduct policies.
